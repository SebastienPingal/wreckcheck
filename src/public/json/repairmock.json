Over time, the A/C may not blow as cold as you want, even though the control is at the coldest setting. Eventually, the compressor will wear out and need to be replaced. Probably the most important part of the air conditioning system, the compressor ensures a constant flow of refrigerant to cool the air channeled into the passenger cabin. Lack of cold air plus noises from clattering bearings or a squealing belt are signs of compressor failure. Although this repair is relatively straightforward, it\u2019s best done by a professional versed in evacuating and recharging the compressor\u2019s refrigerant.  ",

These joints are covered by rubber \u201cboots\u201d which help to keep the axle grease in and water and dirt out. Even the best laid plans go astray and through normal wear and sometimes even literal tears, the front CV Joints fail. It used to be easy to replace the CV Joint. That was then, this is now: Manufacturers suggest replacing the entire axle with a new or a remanufactured unit that is already sealed before installation. This practice is more desirable than rebuilding the faulty CV Joint due to the amount of work involved in the process. This is a job for professionals. ",

Older brakes may need periodic adjustment where the pad is realigned to close the gap between it and the surface by tightening adjustment screws in the brake mechanism.",

When your vehicle turns, the inside wheels don\u2019t need to make as many rotations as the outside wheels, which have a greater distance to cover. The differential helps keep the axle from binding up from this difference in turning rates. A thin coat of oil lubricates these gears, and that oil needs to be changed from time to time. Your owner\u2019s manual or maintenance minder will tell you when to replace it. If the oil becomes contaminated or the level drops too low, the gears could be damaged, which would lead to a more expensive repair or replacement. ",

The belt snakes around the pulleys located at the front of the engine (or the side of a transverse-mounted engine) and drives multiple accessories including the alternator, power steering pump and air conditioning compressor. If it is squeaking or worn, it could break, which would make the engine inoperable. Check it at 60,000 miles but change it before 100,000 miles. Older vehicles usually have separate belts for the water pump, alternator, radiator fan and air conditioning system, but when they break, you still may be able to get home. Finally, engine timing belts help to keep the camshaft and crankshaft in sync so that pistons and valves operate in sync. They typically last from 60,000 to 90,000 miles. A broken timing belt could result in engine damage and an expensive rebuild.  ",

        "description": "A vehicle\u2019s fuel delivery system has progressed quite a bit from the carburetor that used to sit on top of the engine. Today, modern vehicles feature precise fuel injection systems located on top of \u2013 or even inside \u2013 the combustion chamber. Restrictions in fuel flow, electrical problems with the injectors themselves or even dirty or contaminated fuel can all cause trouble. Fuel injectors will typically last between 50,000 and 100,000 miles. Much of this lifespan is determined by the type of fuel used and how often the vehicle\u2019s fuel filters are changed. Some symptoms that your fuel injectors need replacing include an illuminated check engine light, a decrease in fuel efficiency, a smell of fuel (especially near the fuel injectors under the hood) and engine misfiring. Fuel injector replacement is a job best performed by an ASE-certified mechanic at a dealership service department or automotive service center. ",

Servicing your fuel injection system helps to remove waxy build-up & deposits and cleans the intake valves, cylinder heads and fuel delivery lines. This results in an extended engine life, improved performance, and better fuel economy. Most modern engines suggest fuel injector service at 60,000 miles, unless a specific problem crops up. Check your owner\u2019s manual to know for sure with your car. If you notice a certain sluggishness in acceleration and a decrease in fuel economy, it might mean it\u2019s time for a fuel injector service.

Along the way, the fuel passes through a filter, either inside the fuel tank or externally in the fuel flow line. Most fuel pumps will last for the life of the vehicle but occasionally they can fail. Signs of such failure are a car that won\u2019t start or stalls once it has started. Other times, the fuel flow can slowly become starved causing the check engine light to come on. Or if you hear a whirring sound coming from your fuel tank, the fuel pump may be about to fail, since fuel pumps do not normally make noise. A mechanic will need to get to the failed pump through the top of the fuel tank via an access panel in the passenger compartment or by removing the tank from the vehicle.

They are also designed to resist long-term bouts of constant temperature fluctuation from starting and stopping the engine. But after many miles and years of service, the material may wear out, resulting in pressure and coolant leakage and causing the engine to run rough and overheat. A mechanic will replace the intake manifold gasket by removing all components above the cylinder heads that may obscure the gasket from removal. Once they have removed it, the mounting surface is cleaned and resurfaced, and the gasket is replaced. ",

Follow the recommendation from your owner\u2019s manual to see when it\u2019s time to flush the power steering fluid. A mechanic will flush the system by removing dark, discolored power steering fluid and refilling it with fresh fluid, while an assistant turns the steering wheel from left to right to get old fluid out of the system. When the remaining fluid appears like fresh fluid, the system has been successfully flushed. Remove the remaining fluid, refill with fresh power steering fluid and your vehicle should be good for another 100,000 miles. ",

Failure to address the lack of fluid and a subsequent pump malfunction can cause the pump to seize up. At the same time, it\u2019s a good idea to also have all hoses that lead to the pump replaced to minimize the chance of subsequent power steering fluid leaks. Many newer vehicles have gone to electrically assisted power steering, which eliminates the use of hydraulic fluid, hoses and the pump itself. ",

        "title": "Timing Belt - Replace",
        "description": "Critical to the operation of your vehicle, the timing belt synchs the operations of the camshaft and the crankshaft so that the valves operate efficiently and safely. Older cars may have a timing chain, similar to a chain on a motorcycle, with a life cycle of around 60,000 miles. Newer models use timing belts made of polyurethane and Kevlar for long life and durability. They can go as long as 100,000 miles although it\u2019s always a good idea to change it before then. Belt failure can cause extensive damage to the valves, pistons and other internal parts of the engine. The cost of changing the timing belt is a bargain when you consider the cost to replace the entire engine. Start thinking about changing the timing belt once you cross the 90,000-mile threshold. Check your owner\u2019s manual for details. ",

        "description": "A tire pressure sensor is designed to warn that one or more of your tires is underinflated. All cars built since 2007 are required to have this system. The most common sensor uses a battery and operates via a wireless transmitter mounted inside the rim of your tire\u2019s wheel. When it detects low pressure, it sends a signal to your vehicle\u2019s computer system that shows up on your instrument panel as an icon of a tire or some other alert. Most warn of low pressure without indicating a specific tire, while more advanced systems can flag an individual wheel or indicate the pressure in each tire. The batteries in tire pressure sensors last around five to seven years but sometimes they can fail earlier. The sensors can also be damaged from potholes or other sudden jarring. Replacing the sensor is easy for a tire retailer or your dealership service department. Your service technician will also electronically reset the system after replacing the sensors or whenever you replace your tires. ",

Less expensive replacement pumps are available, but they might only have a service life of 30,000 miles.",
